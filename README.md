# Landfill Database

Landfill Database is a web app created by Anna Kiefer which is used to search for and display information about U.S. landfills. Integration of the Google Maps API allows the ability to display landfill locations. National and local landfill information is represented using several data visuals, including pie charts and a scatter plot. A landfill gas-to-energy converter displays the Megawatts produced and homes powered for a given landfill's waste in place. Finally, users can update the database by filling out a report form. 

The data is from the EPA's Landfill Methane Outreach Program, downloaded here https://www3.epa.gov/lmop/index.html.
